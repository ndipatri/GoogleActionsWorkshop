# GoogleActionsWorkshop

Words have power! In this workshop, we’ll step outside of our Android comfort zone and create a conversational user experience using the Google Assistant running on our phones. We’ll manipulate the world around us with Internet of Things (IoT) hardware.  

Get ready to learn a taste of Kotlin-based Google Actions fulfillment with Google’s AppEngine, the Particle Photon Arduino platform and possibly Newton’s Laws of Motion as they pertain to Ping Pong balls! (BYOL - bring your own laptop)
 
*** IMPORTANT PRE-REQUISITE FOR THIS WORKSHOP ***

In order to use the AppEngine provided by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for this workshop, you will need to log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google account. In addition, ** you will need to create a billing account with Google using an active credit card ** (see NOTE below for more details on why you need to do this).  Once you are in the GCP console, click on the 'Billing' tab on the left hand side and follow instructions. You can still attend the workshop and listen in and enjoy but you won't be able to create a Google Action using GCP is you don't associate a credit card with your GCP account.

NOTE ON CREATING BILLING ACCOUNT: 

You will be using your own laptop for this workshop.  Although I will go through the process of creating the billing accoount for GCP during the workshop, you can also do this ahead of time. The reason Google asks you to provide your credit card is because they give all GCP accounts a $300 credit and they don't want people making multiple Google accounts to accumulate this credit.  For our workshop, you will not be using any of this credit **nor will you be charging your credit card**, but it's necessary for us to create our Google Action.  Even after a year, your credit card will not be charged. 

Do not click the 'Upgrade' link at the top of the GCP console.  This will ensure your credit card will never be charged. (and even then, it would only be charged if you used all your credit).

Also, **be aware that you providing only Google your credit card on your laptop over HTTPS**, not anyone at the conference nor anyone associated with the conference.

If all this has scared you away from creating a GCP account, that's ok :-) . You can still attend
the workshop and listen in and enjoy but you won't be able to create a Google Action using GCP.
